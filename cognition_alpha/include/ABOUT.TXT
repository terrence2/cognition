Note Well:  This directory is not for project includes.  Rather, it contains various needed system include files for certain broken compiler implementations (read VC98).  

At the moment this only contains SGI's extension database reference for 1.4.  If you are running Visual Studio 6 and are missing glext.h, just copy it from here into your compiler's include/GL directory and retry the build.
